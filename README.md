# la-magnets-2016-test-scores

A database of test scores for roughly 200 L.A. Unified magnet schools obtained by the Los Angeles Times. Published on
Sept. 8, 2016 with ["These magnets have become some of L.A.'s highest-scoring public schools."](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-edu-magnet-test-scores-2016/)

The tests were administered under California's [CAASPP](http://www.caaspp.org/) program by the Los Angeles Unified School District during the 2015-2016 school year. Scores
released by the state do not separate the performance of magnet programs that are hosted on the campus of another school.

This list, typically not made public, was obtained by Sonali Kohli in response to an information request with L.A. Unified.

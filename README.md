# la-magnets-2016-test-scores

A database of test scores for roughly 200 L.A. Unified magnet schools obtained by the Los Angeles Times. Published on
Sept. 8, 2016 with [These magnets have become some of L.A.'s highest-scoring public schools](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-edu-magnet-test-scores-2016/).

The tests were administered under California's [CAASPP](http://www.caaspp.org/) program by the Los Angeles Unified School District during the 2015-2016 school year. Unlike this list, scores
released by the state do not separate the performance of magnet programs that hosted on the campus of another school.
